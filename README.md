# purescript-unicode-prelude

Additional Unicode operators.

This package defines Unicode symbol aliases for a number of functions and operators
in the `Prelude`. Many of these aliases enable the use of standard mathematical notation
in place of ASCII approximations of textual names. For example, `â‹˜` or `âˆ˜` can be used
in place of `<<<` for function composition.

All symbols are documented with their actual definition and their Unicode code point.
They should be completely interchangeable with their definitions.
